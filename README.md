# text_http_client

Is a personal project and there are probably a better tool to do its job, but I wanted a lightweigth tool that could send http requests based on a text file and have support to variables so it is possible to version control my api requests. 

I'm learning rust so if there is a better way of doing things, feel free to contact me.
